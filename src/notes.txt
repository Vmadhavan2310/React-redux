Redux:-
Redux is state management tool used for many libraries like react, angular and vue.js

As we know react can maintain own state for every component but its hard to keept the state available for all components

Redux has been introduced in 2015 and later react introduces use reducer and context API.

Redux has three major things:-
1.Store-Holds the state of your application.
2.action-describes the changes in your state
3.reducer-carries out the state transition depending on your state action.

Redux Principles:-
1.State of your application is stored in object tree within a single store.
2.Only way to change the store is emit an action, an object describes what happened.(store is read only mode)
3.To specify how the state tree is transformed by action, write a pure reducer..
